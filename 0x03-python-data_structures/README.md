# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Project Overview

This project focuses on Python data structures, specifically lists and tuples. The tasks involve writing functions to perform various operations on lists and tuples, such as printing elements, accessing elements at specific indices, replacing elements, printing in reverse, and more.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the basics of Python programming and why it is awesome.
- Work with lists and understand their similarities and differences with strings.
- Utilize common list methods and comprehend their functionalities.
- Use lists as stacks and queues.
- Implement list comprehensions.
- Understand tuples and their use cases.
- Differentiate between tuples and lists.
- Grasp the concept of sequences, tuple packing, and sequence unpacking.
- Utilize the `del` statement and understand its usage.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- Files must end with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Code should adhere to the PEP8 style guide using pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
- All files must be executable.
- File lengths will be tested using `wc`.

### C

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- Files must end with a new line.
- Code should use the Betty style and will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- No global variables allowed.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file `lists.h`.
- Header files should be include guarded.

## Tasks

1. **Print a list of integers (0-print_list_integer.py):**
   - Write a function that prints all integers of a list.

2. **Secure access to an element in a list (1-element_at.py):**
   - Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.

3. **Replace element (2-replace_in_list.py):**
   - Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).

4. **Print a list of integers... in reverse! (3-print_reversed_list_integer.py):**
   - Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.

5. **Replace in a copy (4-new_in_list.py):**
   - Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).

6. **Can you C me now? (5-no_c.py):**
   - Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.

7. **Lists of lists = Matrix (6-print_matrix_integer.py):**
   - Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.

8. **Tuples addition (7-add_tuple.py):**
   - Write a function that adds 2 tuples.

9. **More returns! (8-multiple_returns.py):**
   - Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

10. **Find the max (9-max_integer.py):**
    - Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.

11. **Only by 2 (10-divisible_by_2.py):**
    - Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.

12. **Delete at (11-delete_at.py):**
    - Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.

13. **Switch (12-switch.py):**
    - Complete the source code to switch the value of a and b.

14. **Linked list palindrome (lists.h, 13-is_palindrome.c):**
    - Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

## Usage

Each Python script can be executed individually. For example:
```bash
./0-main.py
